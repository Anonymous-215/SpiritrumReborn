Hello, for those that don't know, this mod is the new and remade Spiritrum Mod.
I simply didn't know where I was going with all the stuff and suddenly completly stopped working on it.
I would like to say thanks to Akira (Creator of Infernal Eclipse of Ragnarok) for giving me
the idea of remaking Spiritrum (not from scratch, but just to simply overhaul).

About the old of Spiritrum (I am going to be transparent here)
Uhhh... idk how to start with this... all the assets were made by me and the community. Completly human and pure brain power.
But about the code ðŸ˜¶uhhh... I actually never knew how to code in the first place... so all of it
is either example mod code or ai code (I am really sorry), but you need to start one way or another.
School, videos, public code or simply an ai designed for coding.
I have taken the decision to not code with any ai model.
The only ai powered thing I will use this time is the github copilot autocomplete if the code makes sense for what I want
Do not hate me, please. Some of the mods are pure ai code, nothing else and their creator doesn't care.
Some code with ai because they simply do not have any friends that can help them or they don't have the time
I work for free and the community work for free (I don't have any way to pay people).
I know some of you will want to say something around: "Ai used, trash mod" in the comment section, but can you pls try to understand what I said?
Ai is a tool designed to help you and not fully replace your brain.
Thank you (if you red everything)


About Spiritrum Reborn
Yeah uh... idk what to put here, but all I can say is that not all items are planned to be transfered.
Most items will get resprited, some items will be retiered/rework, etc.
There is a lot of stuff planned.

Special thanks to:
